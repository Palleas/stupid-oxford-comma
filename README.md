I have been learning a lot about writing technical english and I keep making the same mistakes, including that stupid [oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/). Hopefully this list will help.

Special thanks to my friend [Frank](http://ioscoachfrank.com), my friend [Angelo](http://angelostavrow.com), the Oxford Comma, and my teammate Ewan from whom I've been learning a lot.

## Checklist

* Make sure the introduction covers all the steps you're going to cover.
* Avoid the use of _gerunds_:
    * use "How to make sure that" instead of "Making sure that"
    * Drop the “ing”
    * Use “Learn how to...”
* Avoid making a definitive-sounding statement and then immediately invalidating it.
* Avoid Redundencies (ex: Running a command from a directory and starting the exanple with a `cd`)
* Don't make "that" implicit (ex: "make sure **that** your project...").
* Add commas before "but" (ex: "This command is very straightforward, but").
* Avoid future tense.ok, 
* Directories should be in monospace (ex: `Carthage/Builds/iOS`). Also, if it's a directory, say so.
* The plural of information is information; no s.
* Prefer alphabetical order when making lists so it doesn't suggests a popularity rating.
* Use the oxford comma:
   * "rename your apps, change the repo URL**,** or delete apps"
* compound adjectives need to be hyphenated
   * "purpose built" → "purpose-built"

Also, make sure that you **read your content out loud**.
